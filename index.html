			I grew up Albuquerque, New Mexico. I went to 7 different schools all along the West Side.
			From the South Valley to Taylor Ranch.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started programming my first semester of college and was hooked. I have been looking at ways to improve my coding since I started.
			That is the main reason I decided to take this boot camp.

		<h1>My Recent Computer Project</h1>
		<p>
			Three months ago I built my first PC. This was is one of the things that has been taking up my time for the past few months.
			For the curious I will list my components.
