			I grew up Albuquerque, New Mexico. I went to 7 different schools all along the West Side.
			From the South Valley to Taylor Ranch.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started programming my first semester of college and was hooked. I have been looking at ways to improve my coding since I started.
			That is the main reason I decided to take this boot camp.
